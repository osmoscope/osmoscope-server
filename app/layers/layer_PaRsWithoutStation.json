    "why_problem": "Some P+R parkings are wrongly tagged as park_ride though they are not, or if they are, perhaps a close by station or halt is not mapped correctly or not at all.",
    "how_to_fix": "Check on the ground if this parking is an P+R parking. It might be park_ride for a different mode than train, so perhaps park_rid=bus|hov might be more appropriate. If a station or halt is missing, add or correct it."
